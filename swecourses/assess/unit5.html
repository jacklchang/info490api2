                    <p>As you can see, Mara and her team face a number of challenges. Although releases happen
                        eventually, Mara feels they can happen much more frequently and efficiently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mara hopes she can convince the team it's at least worth testing out a DevOps approach. Perhaps
                        they can apply a few DevOps practices as they finish up work on the Space Game website.

                        What is DevOps?
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        At this point, we haven't yet defined DevOps. We'll do that in the next module. But for now,
                        think of DevOps as something that brings together people, processes and products, automating
                        software delivery to provide continuous value to your users.
                    </p>
                    <p>Azure DevOps is a suite of services that spans the entire DevOps life cycle. Azure
                        DevOps starts with planning and goes all the way through deployment and monitoring. If you
                        already have some pieces in place, you can select which services you want to use. Azure DevOps
                        integrates with many tools, such as Jenkins.</p>
                    <p>We'll go deeper into Azure DevOps in future modules. You can also check out these resources:</p>

                        General recommendations for migrating and consolidating tools to Azure DevOps
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        You've seen how analyzing all your existing artifacts and tools is the first step toward
                        designing a DevOps strategy. Once you've done that, here are a few recommendations for
                        developing migration and integration strategies you can use if you're using Azure DevOps.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class='encountertitles'>
                        Designing an authentication and access strategy
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Azure DevOps Services uses enterprise-grade authentication. You can use either a Microsoft
                        account or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to protect and secure your data. Many client
                        applications such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio code, natively support authentication by
                        either Microsoft Accounts or Azure AD. Eclipse can also support this, if you install a Team
                        Explorer Everywhere plugin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you need a non-Microsoft tool to integrate directly with Azure DevOps Services and the
                        tools don't directly support a Microsoft account or an Azure AD account for authentication, you
                        can still use them by setting up personal access tokens. These tokens can be set up using Git
                        credential managers or you can create them manually.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Personal access tokens are also useful when you need to establish access in command line tools,
                        or in tools and tasks in build pipelines and when calling REST-based APIs, because you don't
                        have a UI popping out to perform the authentication. When access is no longer required you can
                        then just revoke the personal access token.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Azure DevOps is pre-configured with default security groups. Default permissions are assigned to
                        the default security groups. But you can also configure access at the organization level, the
                        collection level and at the project or object level. In the organization settings in Azure
                        DevOps, you can configure app access policies. Based on your security policies, you might allow
                        alternate authentication methods, allow third party applications to access via OAuth or even
                        allow anonymous access to some projects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For even tighter control, you can set conditional access to Azure DevOps. This offers simple
                        ways to help secure resources when using Azure Active Directory for authentication. Conditional
                        access policies such as multifactor authentication can help to minimize the risk of compromised
                        credentials. As part of a conditional access policy you might require security group membership,
                        a particular location or network identity, a specific operating system, a managed device, or
                        other criteria.

                        Migrating and integrating artifact repositories
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        While you can continue to work with your existing artifact repositories in their current
                        locations when using Azure DevOps, there are advantages to migrating them. For NuGet, Azure
                        DevOps Services provides hosted NuGet feeds as a service. By using this service, you can often
                        eliminate the dependencies on on-premises resources such as file shares and locally hosted
                        instances of NuGet.Server. The feeds can also be consumed by any continuous integration system
                        that supports authenticated NuGet feeds.

                    <h5 class='encountertitles'>
                        Designing a licensing strategy
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Azure DevOps has many different licensing policies designed to suit many different situations.
                        To get a quick overview, go to <a
                            href='https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/'>Pricing for
                            Azure DevOps</a> to see what's available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is also a large number of both free and paid extensions, many of which you use to
                        integrate third-party applications. Depending upon your current configuration, you might also
                        decide to implement Group-Based Licensing. This makes it easier to manage licenses in Azure
                        DevOps. If you're planning to make this change though, it's important to avoid a situation where
                        migration to Group-Based Licensing results in users temporarily losing their currently assigned
                        licenses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to Azure DevOps Licensing, you need to ensure you have appropriate licenses for any
                        third party tools that you need. Also, you need to make sure that any open-source tools that you
                        have included have licenses that are compatible with how you intend to use them.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class='encountertitles'>
                        Migrating and integrating source control
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Similarly to artifacts, you might consider migrating your source control to Azure DevOps by
                        using Azure Repos. However, moving your team from a centralized version control system to a
                        distributed system like Git involves much more than learning the new commands. A successful
                        migration to Git requires that you understand the differences in how file history and branches
                        are handled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Azure DevOps team recommends the following process:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Evaluate the tools and processes you're using.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Select a branching strategy for Git.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Decide how to migrate history – or if you even want to.

                        Migrating and integrating work management tools
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        Migrating from other work management tools to Azure DevOps takes considerable planning. Most
                        work management tools are highly configurable by the end user. This means that there might not
                        be a tool available that will perform the migration without further configuration. One example
                        is Jira.

                        offers a tool for Jira to Azure DevOps migration. It
                        does the migration in two phases. Jira issues are exported to files and then the files are
                        imported to Azure DevOps.

                        If you decide to try to write the migration code yourself, the following blog post provides
                        sample code that might help you to get started: <a
