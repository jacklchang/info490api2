            We seek to build a new experience, Microsoft Encounter, a microsite of the Microsoft Learn website, focused on educating users and allowing them to achieve their personal development goals while fostering the adoption of Microsoft products, therefore, building brand loyalty.

Azure allows for the building, testing, and distribution of applications, services, and is a valuable resource for developers around the world, Currently, their platform provides limited education and instruction for new and possibly current users because of the disorganization of the documentation. Microsoft Learn aims to provide educational materials for many products, not just Azure, however, the current content is not specifically curated for findability and reliability for its users to be able to find a streamlined process in navigating the website. . Learn is built off of Microsoft Docs, an established platform of publicly modifiable and shared content surrounding their products. 
Large numbers of different documentations exist within different sectors of Microsoft and there isn’t a concrete way that it is currently architectured. Roughly 70 million developers a month go into Docs to use the platform and the resources within it. However, Microsoft had invested a lot of time, money, and effort into the Microsoft Learn site as a platform to streamline learnability, usability, and make it easier for the 70 million users to access the content, but the Learn site doesn’t get much traffic

Our sponsors have asked us to look at this issue from a student perspective. Students are a primary audience of any new technology, as they are the industry leaders of tomorrow. Our goal is to work with our sponsor to be able to serve undergraduate students at the University of Washington.



Our sponsor said that “If you can build loyalty early on, they
become lifelong customers, however, in order to establish that, the company
must first build a product they can use more reliably, leading them to trust the
company and their products.” Our sponsors want to get the content to be easily
found and organized.

The initial research our sponsors have done gave them a lot of bad scores
about findability. Their project managers and higher-level stakeholders have
done nothing to fix findability.


Our sponsors want us to look at this problem through the lens of an
undergraduate student. They want to see how they can reach both technical
and non-technical students to use their content so that they can build lifetime
brand recognition and loyalty on their Learn and Docs platforms.
By filling this content-gap, we will be able to connect students to these
Microsoft resources and provide them with the skills to become adept users,
thereby turning them into lifelong customers.
