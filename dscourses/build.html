                        <div class="text-light">
                            <p>To create a machine learning model, you need two datasets: one for training and one for
                                testing. In practice, you often have only one dataset, so you split it into two. In this
                                exercise, you will perform an 80-20 split on the DataFrame you prepared in the previous
                                lab so you can use it to train a machine learning model. You will also separate the
                                DataFrame into feature columns and label columns. The former contains the columns used
                                as input to the model (for example, the flight's origin and destination and the
                                scheduled departure time), while the latter contains the column that the model will
                                attempt to predict â€” in this case, the ARR_DEL15 column, which indicates whether a
                                flight will arrive on time.
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Switch back to the Azure notebook that you created in the previous section. If you
                                    closed the notebook, you can sign back into the Microsoft Azure Notebooks portal ,
                                    open your notebook, and use the Cell -> Run All to rerun the all of the cells in the
                                    notebook after opening it.
                                </li>
                                <li>In a new cell at the end of the notebook, enter and execute the following
                                    statements:
                                </li>
                                <p>from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
                                    train_x, test_x, train_y, test_y = train_test_split(df.drop('ARR_DEL15', axis=1),
                                    df['ARR_DEL15'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)</p>
                                <p>The first statement imports scikit-learn's train_test_split helper function. The
                                    second line uses the function to split the DataFrame into a training set containing
                                    80% of the original data, and a test set containing the remaining 20%. The
                                    random_state parameter seeds the random-number generator used to do the splitting,
                                    while the first and second parameters are DataFrames containing the feature columns
                                    and the label column.
                                </p>
                                <li>train_test_split returns four DataFrames. Use the following command to display the
                                    number of rows and columns in the DataFrame containing the feature columns used for
                                    training:
                                </li>
                                <p>train_x.shape
                                </p>
                                <li>Now use this command to display the number of rows and columns in the DataFrame
                                    containing the feature columns used for testing:
                                </li>
                                <p>test_x.shape
                                </p>
                                <p>How do the two outputs differ, and why?
                                </p>
                                <p>Can you predict what you would see if you called shape on the other two DataFrames,
                                    train_y and test_y? If you're not sure, try it and find out.
                                </p>
                                <p>There are many types of machine learning models. One of the most common is the
                                    regression model, which uses one of a number of regression algorithms to produce a
                                    numeric value â€” for example, a person's age or the probability that a credit-card
                                    transaction is fraudulent. You'll train a classification model, which seeks to
                                    resolve a set of inputs into one of a set of known outputs. A classic example of a
                                    classification model is one that examines e-mails and classifies them as "spam" or
                                    "not spam." Your model will be a binary classification model that predicts whether a
                                    flight will arrive on-time or late ("binary" because there are only two possible
                                    outputs).
                                </p>
                            </ol>
                            <ol>
                                <p>One of the benefits of using scikit-learn is that you don't have to build these
                                    models â€” or implement the algorithms that they use â€” by hand. Scikit-learn includes
                                    a variety of classes for implementing common machine learning models. One of them is
                                    RandomForestClassifier, which fits multiple decision trees to the data and uses
                                    averaging to boost the overall accuracy and limit overfitting.
                                </p>
                                <li>Execute the following code in a new cell to create a RandomForestClassifier object
                                    and train it by calling the fit method.
                                </li>
                                <p>from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

                                    model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=13)
                                    model.fit(train_x, train_y)
                                </p>
                                <p>The output shows the parameters used in the classifier, including n_estimators, which
                                    specifies the number of trees in each decision-tree forest, and max_depth, which
                                    specifies the maximum depth of the decision trees. The values shown are the
                                    defaults, but you can override any of them when creating the RandomForestClassifier
                                    object.
                                </p>

                                <li>Now call the predict method to test the model using the values in test_x, followed
                                    by the score method to determine the mean accuracy of the model:
                                </li>
                                <p>predicted = model.predict(test_x)
                                    model.score(test_x, test_y)</p>
                                <p>Confirm that you see the following output:
                                </p>

                                <p>The mean accuracy is 86%, which seems good on the surface. However, mean accuracy
                                    isn't always a reliable indicator of the accuracy of a classification model. Let's
                                    dig a little deeper and determine how accurate the model really is â€” that is, how
                                    adept it is at determining whether a flight will arrive on time.
                                </p>
                                <p>There are several ways to measure the accuracy of a classification model. One of the
                                    best overall measures for a binary classification model is Area Under Receiver
                                    Operating Characteristic Curve (sometimes referred to as "ROC AUC"), which
                                    essentially quantifies how often the model will make a correct prediction regardless
                                    of the outcome. In this unit, you'll compute an ROC AUC score for the model you
                                    built previously and learn about some of the reasons why that score is lower than
                                    the mean accuracy output by the score method. You'll also learn about other ways to
                                    gauge the accuracy of the model.
                                </p>
                            </ol>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Before you compute the ROC AUC, you must generate prediction probabilities for the
                                    test set. These probabilities are estimates for each of the classes, or answers, the
                                    model can predict. For example, [0.88199435, 0.11800565] means that there's an 89%
                                    chance that a flight will arrive on time (ARR_DEL15 = 0) and a 12% chance that it
                                    won't (ARR_DEL15 = 1). The sum of the two probabilities adds up to 100%.
                                </li>
                                <p>Run the following code to generate a set of prediction probabilities from the test
                                    data:
                                </p>
                                <p>from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
                                    probabilities = model.predict_proba(test_x)</p>
                                <li>Now use the following statement to generate an ROC AUC score from the probabilities
                                    using scikit-learn's roc_auc_score method:
                                </li>
                                <p>roc_auc_score(test_y, probabilities[:, 1])
                                </p>
                                <p>Confirm that the output shows a score of 67%:
                                </p>
                                <img
                                    src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/student-evangelism/predict-flight-delays-with-python/media/3-auc-score.png">
                                <p>Why is the AUC score lower than the mean accuracy computed in the previous exercise?
                                </p>
                                <p>The output from the score method reflects how many of the items in the test set the
                                    model predicted correctly. This score is skewed by the fact that the dataset the
                                    model was trained and tested with contains many more rows representing on-time
                                    arrivals than rows representing late arrivals. Because of this imbalance in the
                                    data, you're more likely to be correct if you predict that a flight will be on time
                                    than if you predict that a flight will be late.
                                </p>
                                <p>ROC AUC takes this into account and provides a more accurate indication of how likely
                                    it is that a prediction of on-time or late will be correct.
                                </p>
                                <li>You can learn more about the model's behavior by generating a confusion matrix, also
                                    known as an error matrix. The confusion matrix quantifies the number of times each
                                    answer was classified correctly or incorrectly. Specifically, it quantifies the
                                    number of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives. This
                                    is important, because if a binary classification model trained to recognize cats and
                                    dogs is tested with a dataset that is 95% dogs, it could score 95% simply by
                                    guessing "dog" every time. But if it failed to identify cats at all, it would be of
                                    little value.
                                </li>
                                <p>Use the following code to produce a confusion matrix for your model:
                                </p>
                                <p>from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
                                    confusion_matrix(test_y, predicted)</p>
                                <p>The first row in the output represents flights that were on time. The first column in
                                    that row shows how many flights were correctly predicted to be on time, while the
                                    second column reveals how many flights were predicted as delayed but weren't. From
                                    this, the model appears to be adept at predicting that a flight will be on time.
                                </p>
                                <img
                                    src="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/student-evangelism/predict-flight-delays-with-python/media/3-confusion-matrix.png">
                                <p>But look at the second row, which represents flights that were delayed. The first
                                    column shows how many delayed flights were incorrectly predicted to be on time. The
                                    second column shows how many flights were correctly predicted to be delayed.
                                    Clearly, the model isn't nearly as adept at predicting that a flight will be delayed
                                    as it is at predicting that a flight will arrive on time. What you want in a
                                    confusion matrix is large numbers in the upper-left and lower-right corners, and
                                    small numbers (preferably zeros) in the upper-right and lower-left corners.
                                </p>
                                <li>Other measures of accuracy for a classification model include precision and recall.
                                    Suppose the model was presented with three on-time arrivals and three delayed
                                    arrivals, and that it correctly predicted two of the on-time arrivals, but
                                    incorrectly predicted that two of the delayed arrivals would be on time. In this
                                    case, the precision would be 50% (two of the four flights it classified as being on
                                    time actually were on time), while its recall would be 67% (it correctly identified
                                    two of the three on-time arrivals). You can learn more about precision and recall
                                    from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall

                                <p>Scikit-learn contains a handy method named precision_score for computing precision.
                                    To quantify the precision of your model, execute the following statements:

                                    precision_score(train_y, train_predictions)</p>

                                <p>In the real world, a trained data scientist would look for ways to make the model
                                    even more accurate. Among other things, they would try different algorithms and take
                                    steps to tune the chosen algorithm to find the optimum combination of parameters.
                                    Another likely step would be to expand the dataset to millions of rows rather than a
                                    few thousand and also attempt to reduce the imbalance between late and on-time
                                    arrivals. But for our purposes, the model is fine as-is.
